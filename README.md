- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ninju4821, a hobbyist programmer in high school.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer programming, ESPORTS, Soccer, Track and Field, and many other things!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and JS for web development and Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I have a few hobbyist projects I work on during my freetime.
- 📫 How to reach me: frankly, you don't unless it's issue related on any particular repo.
